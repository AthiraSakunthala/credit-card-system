# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
First you need to build the project
### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

You should be seeing a simple UI where you can provide Name, card Number and Limit. On click of submit, the application calls the REST endpoints exposed and 
gets saved in the database.

At the same time, there is a table which shows the list of all credit cards in the system.

CreditCards.js takes care of saving and getting the credit card information.
